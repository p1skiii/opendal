Summary: You wanted to refactor the OpenDAL Python bindings into smaller, independent packages to 
reduce the overall size and improve modularity. We've successfully established the core architecture 
using Cargo workspaces and shared crates, and created the `opendal-core`, `opendal-database`, 
`opendal-cloud`, and `opendal-advanced` packages.

We've also implemented a smart routing system in the main `opendal` package 
(`python/opendal/__init__.py`) to delegate requests to the appropriate sub-package based on the service
 scheme. This ensures 100% API backward compatibility.

Currently, we've completed the initial setup and basic functionality tests for all packages. We've also
 verified that the routing system correctly directs requests to the appropriate sub-packages. The 
independent package tests confirmed that each service package can work in isolation.

However, we've identified some issues during testing:
- **Service Configuration Errors**: `redb`, `persy`, and `mini-moka` require specific configurations or
 might not be enabled correctly.
- **API Compatibility Issues**: The test script used non-existent methods (`writer`, `reader`) and had 
issues with asynchronous list iteration.
- **Dependency Resolution**: When using `uv build` or `pip install` with optional dependencies, we 
encountered `ModuleNotFoundError` because the sub-packages weren't properly linked or installed in the 
test environment.
- **Test Environment Setup**: Creating isolated virtual environments for testing can be time-consuming.

To continue, we need to:
1. **Fix the identified bugs**: Address the service configuration and API compatibility issues.
2. **Refine the testing strategy**:
    - Implement the full `test_optional_dependencies.py` to verify `pip install opendal[x]` scenarios.
    - Implement the `test_local_installation.py` to test installation and functionality in isolated 
environments, leveraging editable installs.
    - Address the `pkg_resources` issue in `test_basic_functionality.py` by using `importlib.metadata`.
3. **Address dependency resolution**: Ensure that `uv` or `pip` can correctly resolve and install local
 packages with optional dependencies without relying on PyPI versions.
4. **Perform volume testing**: Measure the actual size reduction and verify that installing multiple 
optional dependencies doesn't lead to bloat or conflicts.
5. **Conduct integration testing**: Ensure all parts work together seamlessly.

Helpful files and commands:
- **`pyproject.toml`**: Defines project metadata, build system, and optional dependencies. Crucial for 
understanding how packages are structured and how to install them.
- **`Cargo.toml` (workspace)**: Defines the Rust workspace and its members (`shared`, `packages/*`). 
Important for understanding the Rust side of the project.
- **`python/opendal/__init__.py`**: Contains the smart routing logic (`_get_service_package`, 
`Operator`, `AsyncOperator`). Essential for understanding how requests are dispatched.
- **`packages/*/Cargo.toml`**: Defines features for each service package. Important for understanding 
which services are included.
- **`tests/test_basic_functionality.py`**: Contains initial tests for imports, routing, and basic 
service availability.
- **`tests/test_independent_packages.py`**: Tests each package's isolation.
- **`tests/test_optional_dependencies.py`**: Tests `pip install opendal[x]` scenarios.
- **`test_current_status.py`**: A quick check script for the current environment state.
- **`uv build` / `uv pip install`**: Commands used for building and installing packages in isolated 
environments.
- **`cargo check`**: Used to check Rust code for errors.
- **`OPENDAL_TEST=fs OPENDAL_FS_ROOT=/tmp pytest ...`**: Example command for running tests with 
specific configurations.
